 - Description: The logic that goes behind computer programming and my love for creating new innovative solutions lead me to choosing computer science as my major. One of my favorite interests is to learn about new technologies and skills as I am constantly looking to expand and broaden my horizons no matter the specific field I end up in. Besides working on this, in my free time, I love to play sports and go on adventures to explore new places!
